# NavierStokes_FEM_in_100lines
Solving Navier stokes equation using FEM in 100 lines
Dealing with pressure term in N-S equation could be chanllenging, and this code is a short demo for tackling pressure term.
The project is from ME572 course project

Contains a stokes flow solver in 90 lines and a non-linera navier-stokes equation solver in 140 lines.
